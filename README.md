chat this is the dsa final project of los cachetones:

Project Proposal:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZytCwRV1oUsIJ4HXHwAo1ogniZ6d3f_8n9LJ5o7c28A/edit?tab=t.0

TO-DO:

1. make final choice on what 2 algorithms/data structures to use and compare

   **- Data Structure Comparison Idea: use a max heap to find which major fits best with the user that is trying to find what major is best for him or her, and then use graphs to connect similar nodes of majors that can be close to the max heap, for example the child of the root node of the max heap would be the other closest fitting majors, and the further away from the root node, the further away it is from the main major chosen.**
     
2. find out how we are actually getting our data and exactly how we are organizing it/looking for

    **- I found these websites that have data sets:
         https://www.kaggle.com/search?q=College+Majors+in%3Adatasets <- this has datasets for college majors, still have to do a further dive on how to use it though.
         https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/ <- we can find our data sets through this as well
         https://data.gov/ <- last one I found**
        

4. get the data, make data structures/algorithms from scratch.
5. make pretty frontend bc we are chill like that and we know react
6. code the rest
