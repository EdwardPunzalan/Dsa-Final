chat this is the dsa final project of los cachetones:

Project Proposal:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZytCwRV1oUsIJ4HXHwAo1ogniZ6d3f_8n9LJ5o7c28A/edit?tab=t.0

TO-DO:

1. make final choice on what 2 algorithms/data structures to use and compare





- Data Structures:

1. Max Heap: Based on the input that we get from the user, we turn these choices into an ID:
      - Example:
          answer 1: interest in Math & science (ID: 1)
          answer 2: Highly Creative (ID: 4)
          answer 3: interest Solving logical problems (ID: 3)
          answer 4: Highly Social (ID: 4)
          answer 5: interest in Developing Groundbreaking technology (ID: 5)

        combined ID: 14345

        now look through all majors with this ID and get the scale from 1-10 for each major with this ID, insert each major based on the scale into the Max heap and the   
        major with this highest rank with this ID is output to the user.

        - Example continued:

          Major: Electrical Engineering: ID: 14345 => Scale : 5
          Major: Health Science: ID: 14345 => Scale: 3
          Major: Math: ID: 14345 => Scale: 9
          Major: Englis: ID: 14345 => Scale: 1

          input values into Max Heap based on Scale => MaxHeap.Top => Math

          Therefore, the recommended major for the user would be math.
          Second recommendation, Electrical Engineering.







     
3. find out how we are actually getting our data and exactly how we are organizing it/looking for

    **- I found these websites that have data sets:
         https://www.kaggle.com/search?q=College+Majors+in%3Adatasets <- this has datasets for college majors, still have to do a further dive on how to use it though.
         https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/ <- we can find our data sets through this as well

         https://data.gov/ <- last one I found**
        

4. get the data, make data structures/algorithms from scratch.
5. make pretty frontend bc we are chill like that and we know react
6. code the rest
