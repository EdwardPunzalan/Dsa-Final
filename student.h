     REMINDERS:
     - make sure that max heap and min heap count as 2 different data structures
     - import the csv file into this folder and use that to make the heap

     NOTES:
     - Steffano: created the front end for the console, getting the ID from the user
     based on number inputs, created the student class and templates of other functions.
     I will continue the front end once the time taken and heap functions are created to
     obtain data from them. Lmk if you guys need help with any of the functions.
